# AllDarkThemeV1
A totally black theme which force every software to turn on dark mode. Despite myself, the hypertext of a site already visited is in green, and the images of php built in webpage are hidden.
Compare the difference here : 

Copy the file to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes

If you want to change automatically white (in the morning) to dark mode (evening), then install this app : https://github.com/adrianmteo/Luna
