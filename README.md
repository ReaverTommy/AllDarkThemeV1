# AllDarkThemeV1 for Windows 10/11
A totally black theme which force every software to turn on dark mode. Despite myself, the hypertext of a site already visited is in green, and the images of php built in webpage are hidden. It highlight the text in gray into the Firefox PDF reader, and turn the all document in dark in Edge PDF reader.

Compare the difference here : 

Copy the file to C:\Windows\Resources\Themes

If you want to change automatically white (in the morning) to dark mode (evening), then install this app : https://github.com/adrianmteo/Luna
